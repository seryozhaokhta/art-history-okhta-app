The scenes in which Christ is the protagonist are divided into two sequences that narrate the events of his life and Passion. In order to underline their paradigmatic and universal value, the scenes have been placed on two facing registers that run in parallel fashion along the walls and are superimposed in such a way as to establish specific correspondences between them.

Five scenes on the right wall represent the Nativity (no. 1), the Adoration of the Magi (No. 2), the Presentation in the Temple (No. 3), the Flight into Egypt (No. 4), and the Massacre of the Innocents (No. 5). The next six scenes on the left wall - Christ among the Doctors (No. 6), the Baptism of Christ No. 7), the Marriage at Cana (No. 8), the Raising of Lazarus (No. 9), the Entry into Jerusalem No. 10), and the Expulsion of the Money-changers from the Temple (No. 11) - have the most solemn narrative tone of all the frescoes.

After the scene of Judas's Betrayal on the triumphal arch wall (No. 12), the story continues on the tier below, on the window-side (right side) of the chapel. Here we have a symmetrical arrangement (an outdoor scene flanked by two indoor scenes) of scenes from the Passion of Christ - the Last Supper (No. 13), the Washing of Feet (No. 14), the Arrest of Christ (No. 15), Christ before Caiaphas (No. 16), and the Mocking of Christ (No. 17).

In the lower tier on the left wall are the Road to Calvary (No. 18), the Crucifixion (No. 19), the Lamentation (No. 20), the Resurrection (No. 21, represented by the Noli me tangere scene instead of the three Marys at the tomb), the Ascension (No. 22), and the Pentecost (No. 23).

In the construction of the scenes are particularly important the architecture and the expert use of perspective, which are always strictly functional for a clear layout of the story.
