St Bonaventure described the life of St Francis in a great theological work as an example to the faithful. He divided the saints journey through life into ninety-seven stations, from which twenty-eight scenes were selected for the pictorial narrative, these being further identified by inscriptions. The life story begins in the fourth bay of the north wall, that is, directly adjoining the crossing, with the Homage of a Simple Man, and ends with the Liberation of the Heretic Peter (not by Giotto), a miracle ascribed to St Francis after his death.
