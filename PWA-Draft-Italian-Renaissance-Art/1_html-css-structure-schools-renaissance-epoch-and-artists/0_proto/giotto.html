                                    Giotto was born into a peasant family in Florence

                                    . His talent for drawing was discovered
                    by the famous artist
                                    <a href="#" class="artist-link" data-tippy-content="Cimabue (1240&nbsp;–1302) was an Italian painter and designer of mosaics from Florence."> Cimabue</a>

                    Giotto studied the techniques and styles that Cimabue used in his works.

                                    Unlike most of his contemporaries, Giotto strived for realism in his works. He depicted people and
                    scenes as they appear in real life, not in the idealized form used by many artists of the time. This included the
                    depiction of emotions, movement, and space with incredible accuracy. This approach became the basis for the development of
                    perspective in art, which became a key element in the works of many artists of the

                    of Saint Francis and demonstrate Giotto's mastery in depicting emotions and movement. Another landmark work is the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua, 
                    where he created a series of frescoes depicting scenes from the life of Mary and Christ.

                                    The influence of Giotto on Renaissance art is hard to overstate. His striving for realism and mastery in depicting emotions and space became the foundation for many artists who followed him.

                                Giotto skillfully uses composition to direct the viewer's gaze to the main figures. All lines and movements lead to the

                                Giotto is known for his ability to convey emotion and drama: Judas, embracing Christ, appears as a traitor, but his
                    figure also expresses some uncertainty and fear. Christ, on the other hand, is depicted as calm and dignified, accepting
                    his fate.
